# Existing Solution

**1. Automated Testing Frameworks**

Automated testing frameworks like [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io), and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) allow developers to automate web application testing. These tools are powerful and flexible, enabling comprehensive test coverage across various scenarios. However, they often require developers to write detailed scripts or code to define the tests, which can be time-consuming and complex.

**2. Record and Playback Tools**

Tools like [Testim](https://www.testim.io), [Katalon Studio](https://katalon.com), and [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide) simplify testing by allowing you to record your interactions with the application and replay them to verify functionality, making them accessible to non-developers by eliminating the need to write code. However, these tools have their limitations. They can struggle with complex scenarios, as the recorded tests might not capture all the nuances needed for thorough testing. Additionally, these tests can become brittle when the UI changes, requiring manual intervention to update and maintain them.

**3. AI-Powered Testing Tools**

When i see the [Mabl](https://www.mabl.com) i think they provide various solution. but the pricing is hidding.
On the [Test.ai](https://test.ai/all-products) they provide various solution too. but the pricing is hidding.

**4. Codeless Testing Platforms**

Codeless testing platforms like Leapwork and TestCraft make it easier to create tests without writing code, using drag-and-drop interfaces that are user-friendly. But even with these tools, you still need to spend time manually designing and setting up your test cases.
